Munnar is a quaint town and an idyllic hill station located in the Western Ghats of Kerala. Set at an altitude of 6000 ft in the district of Idukki, Munnar used to be the summer resort of the British rulers during colonial times. It is known for its green belt of lush forests and unending expanse of tea estates and is also home to some of the endangered species of animals like Neelakurinji and Nilgiri Tahr. It is known to be one of the most sought after tourist destinations in South India due to its pristine valleys, mountains, and exotic varieties of flora and fauna. </p>
